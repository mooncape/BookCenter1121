1.1 run 'bundle exec rake db:migrate',to generate sql file
2. you can visit http://localhost:3000/signup to register a new user
3. and visit http://localhost:3000/signin to sign in 
4. then you can use the sessin info in the development. you can see the example line I add in YHList.html.erb line 86:
  the var 'current_user' is an object contain the current session, like 
  current_user[:id] is the item id in database(primary key)
  current_user[:name] is user name(you can chang the code to see the effect)
5. I think you can use the user id(current_user[:id]) or email(current_user[:email]) to do book select.
